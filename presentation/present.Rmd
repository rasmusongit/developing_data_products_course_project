# Slide 1
What do you do when you need to fit a model to some data, but have no automatic tools available?

You cant remember how to do it by hand, and you dont understand the consequences of changing the parameters 

# Slide 2

## You need to practice!

We are introducing a practice tool where you get to fit a polynomial to some data.



# Slide 3

We are fitting data to a function like 

```{r eval=FALSE}
y <- a + b (x-x0) + c (x-x0)^2 + d (x-x0)
```

# Slide 4

You will be scored by the root mean square error, and the goal is to get as low a number as possible.
